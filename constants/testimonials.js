        "We can‚Äôt thank Jacki and John enough for taking such amazing care of our River. He was so well cared for and made many new friends. We know it was a huge task to take on as he is a boisterous puppy. However, he had an amazing time and Jacki put us at ease and we know we can trust her fully with our little man. We have already booked in his next stay. Thanks Jacki and John.",

        "Jacki & John are the absolute best. We have been leaving Ziggy in their care since last year. Fills my heart to see the love and care he receives from them. We recently went on our first trip oversees in years and honestly leaving our boy with them gave us so much peace of mind.",

        "I don‚Äôt typically write reviews unless I would recommend to family and friends - and in this case I will be. Jacki and John are the real deal when it comes to Frenchie care. They‚Äôre home is honestly like a holiday house for Frenchies! Our 18 month old boy Dobby spent 10 nights with Jacki and John and loved it. He could not have been cared for more. This is definitely a home stay that I would not only highly recommend but am keen to use ongoing. I know I don‚Äôt need to stress about going on holidays anymore now. Thank you Jacki and John from Dobby and Geri",

        "I just picked up my 10 month old girl from Jackie this morning. She definitely enjoyed her holiday as much as I did, maybe more. It was my first time leaving her and my only concern was she wouldn‚Äôt want to come back home! I would highly recommend leaving your Frenchies with Jackie she is really amazing and will definitely be using her again. üòç",

        "Jacki is a true Frenchie lover! Lovely in person and through messages, she made us feel confident that our precious puppy ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù would be well taken care of. She had our pup for 2 weeks and always stayed in touch with photos and videos of our boy at the park and lovingly asleep on the couch. Jacki even made the long drive over to us to pick up and drop off our pup. If you looking for someone to trust with your beloved pet, I would highly recommend Jacki.",

        "Thankyou Jackie for taking such excellent care of our frenchie Luna over the Christmas/New Year period. The communication and level of care Luna received was excellent. It was really lovely to get updates of what the pack was up to while we were away. I would not hesitate to use Jackie again, the dogs are very well looked after and became part of the family during their stay. Fantastic!",
